# HTML Hello World

This sample demonstrates a tiny Hello World HTML app for [App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service).

# Azure

##### Configure static website hosting
The first step is to configure your storage account to host a static website in the Azure portal. When you configure your account for static website hosting, Azure Storage automatically creates a container named $web. The $web container will contain the files for your static website.

- Open the Azure portal in your web browser.
- Locate your storage account and display the account overview.
- Select Static website to display the configuration page for static websites.
- Select Enabled to enable static website hosting for the storage account.

In the Index document name field, specify a default index page of index.html. The default index page is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website.

In the Error document path field, specify a default error page of 404.html. The default error page is displayed when a user attempts to navigate to a page that does not exist in your static website.

- Click Save. The Azure portal now displays your static website endpoint.

# Create website/web app

- Navigate to your development folder on your local hard drive (i.e. C:\development)
- mkdir quickstart
- cd quickstart
- git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
- cd html-docs-hello-world
- ls
- mkdir src
- mv css/ js/ fonts/ img/ to src folder
- Open index.html and prepend all css/ js/ fonts/ img/ location with src/

# Parcel
Building a web app with Parcel
https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/

##### Create a package.json
- npm init

Before we get started, you'll need to install Node and Yarn or npm, and create a directory for your project. 

- npm install --save-dev parcel

Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild your app as you make changes. To start it, run the parcel CLI pointing to your entry file:

- npx parcel index.html

##### Package scripts
So far, weâ€™ve been running the parcel CLI directly, but it can be useful to create some scripts in your package.json file to make this easier. We'll also setup a script to build your app for production using the parcel build command. Finally, you can also declare your entries in a single place using the source field so you don't need to duplicate them in each parcel command.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "source": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "latest"
  }
}
```

Now you can run yarn build to build your project for production and yarn start to start the development server.

- npx parcel build

##### Deploy to Azure

Locate your storage account and display the account overview.

- Click on Containers
- Click on $web
- Click on Upload
- Select Files ( a dialog window sould appear)

Navigate to the dist folder and select all files

- Click Open button on Dialog window
- Click Upload

##### Test Website

Locate your storage account and display the account overview.

- Select Static website to display the configuration page for static websites.
- Copy Primary endpoint and paste in Web Browser to view web app
